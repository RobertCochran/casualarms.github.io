		<h2>Mascot Concept Art Contest</h2>
		
		<img id="bot" src="#"/>
		
		<p>We are bringing Casual ARMS into its next stage of life and we want all of YOU to help bring to life <em>an official Casual ARMS mascot!</em></p>

<p>Over the next month, we will be accepting submissions of concept art for a Casual ARMS mascot in the <span class="command">#contest-submissions</span> channel on the <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord server</em></a>. Any art concepts submitted in that channel before <strong>December 31st, 11:59 PM Eastern Time</strong> will be judged by the CA administrative staff and a public vote!<p>

		<h3>Winners</h3>
<p>We will have three winners: the winner of the popular vote, an honorable mention from our judges, and our <em>GRAND PRIZE WINNER</em>. </p>
		<p>All three will receive one of the last remaining stock of our <a href="/wristbands/">Casual ARMS wristbands</a>. Our </em>GRAND PRIZE WINNER</em> will also receive a $10 eshop card and have their concept art selected for our <em>new official mascot</em>, to be used for future branding and promotional art! </p>

<p><i>All credit for the winning mascot design will be given to the original artist. By submitting, you grant Casual ARMS rights to use your mascot design in any future logos, promotional banners, and other community graphics if you are selected as a winner. The winner will be contacted via DM on <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord</em></a>.</i></p>

	<h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
<p>
We are looking for a mascot to <em>represent the Casual ARMS community</em> featuring these qualities:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original character (not Biff or an existing Nintendo character)</li>
<li>Simple design</li>
<li>Friendly but sporty</li>
<li>Featuring the Casual ARMS colors - light blue (#0991ff) and yellow (#ffff00)</li>
<li>Customizable for different games to represent our different events (ARMS, Splatoon2, Smash, Minecraft, etc.). This can be through an accessory, an outfit, a shapeshift, whatever - be creative! </li>
</ul>

<p>All submissions must follow our usual community guidelines (see the <span class="command">#welcome</span> channel on <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord</em></a>). </p>

<p>Art does not have to be final. We are looking for a CONCEPT! Ideas can be fully realized digital illustrations or sketches on notebook paper. Anyone can submit up to <strong>three entries.</strong></p>
