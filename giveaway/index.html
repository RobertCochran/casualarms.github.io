		<p>In celebration of the new release of <em class="mm">SUPER MARIO MAKER 2</em>, we will be giving away a physical copy of the game at the end of August to one lucky winner who doesn't already own it! All you need to do to sign up is type <span class="command">!giveaway</span> in <span class="command">#bot-channel</span> in the <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord server</em></a>. Your odds of winning will be determined by your placement in our monthly <em style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">ARMS</em> <a href="/leaderboards/#monthly">leaderboard</a>, so participate in as many of our Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday <a href="/events/">leaderboard events</a> as you can for your best shot!</p>
		
		<p>We ask that anyone who already owns a copy of the game please refrain from entering this giveaway so that those who don't own a copy will have a better chance to earn one of their own. We will contact the winner on <em class="mm">September 1st</em> to arrange for shipping. As Casual ARMS is an international community, members from <em class="mm">all around the world</em> are welcome to participate.</p>
		
		<p>Be sure to check out the rest of our website for more information on our <a href="/clash/">tournaments</a> and <a href="/events/">events</a>, including our entire schedule listed in your local time. You can also show your support on our <a href='https://www.patreon.com/CasualARMS'><em style="background-color: #f36b61;">Patreon</em></a>. All funds raised go back into the server for leaderboard prizes, tournament prizes, and giveaways like this one</p>
