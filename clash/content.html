		<h2>Casual Tournaments</h2>
		
		<p>The Casual ARMS <a href="https://discord.gg/5A7QkPC"><em class="discord-bg">Discord server</em></a> is proud to bring you a <em>new</em> Swiss style tournament! In this tournament format, there is <em>no elimination</em> and all fights will be held as a <em>Hedlok Scramble</em>. You will play a series of rounds against other players with similar win-loss rates to you. Your individual fights will all matter, so be sure to report your full results of each fight. Players will be ranked at the end for points earned, and the player with the most points will be the winner!</p>
		
		<p>Please read all the rules, and be ready to have tons of fun with us!</p>
