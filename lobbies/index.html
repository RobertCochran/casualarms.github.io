		<h2>Lobby Events</h2>
		
		<p>The Casual ARMS lobby events are for all ARMS players to join in! We run custom party lobbies in the "friend lobby" mode, so you just need to add one of the lobby hosts as a Switch friend to participate. The hosts are shown on the promotional banner for each event, which is always found on the Casual ARMS <a href="http://discord.gg/u6cfeN9">Discord server</a> as well as on <a href="https://twitter.com/casualARMS">Twitter</a>.
		
		<p>There are two types of events: <em>Leaderboard events</em> where the player's lobby coins are counted and added to the leaderboards (on Discord). <em>Warmup events</em> are just for fun and/or to let players get in shape for community tournaments.</p>
		
		<h2>Leaderboard Lobby Event Schedule</h2>
		
		<p>The following three weekly events all count for the Casual ARMS leaderboards!</p>
