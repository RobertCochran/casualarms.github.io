		<h2>Casual Tournaments</h2>
		
		<p>Thanks to your generous support through our Patreon, all major tournaments held by Casual ARMS will now feature prize packages! All participants will be eligible for these prizes as detailed below.</p>
		<p>All Casual ARMS tournament prizes will be distributed via random drawing with odds of winning determined by each participant's performance. Winning a fight earns .5 points with an additional 1 point awarded for the winner of every match (.5 each for a tie). A bye awards 2 points. At the end of each tournament, all accumulated points will serve as entries in the drawing for any prizes being distributed. Each participant can win only one prize per event.</p>
		
		<p>Tournaments at Casual ARMS feature a Swiss style ruleset, which means there are <em>no eliminations</em>. You will play a series of rounds against other players with similar win-loss rates to you. Your individual fights will all matter, so be sure to report your full results of each fight as detailed in the rules below. Players will be ranked at the end for points earned, and the player with the most points will be the winner!</p>
		
		<p>Please read all the rules before participating, and be ready to have tons of fun with us at Casual ARMS!</p>
